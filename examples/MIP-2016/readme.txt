PAR10 performances of modern solvers on the solvable instances of MIPLIB2010.
http://miplib.zib.de/

The algorithm runtime data was directly taken from the '12 threads' table of
H. Mittelmann's evaluations.

The features were generated using the MIP feature computation code from
http://www.cs.ubc.ca/labs/beta/Projects/EPMs/

To record runtimes of the feature computations, runsolver was used:
